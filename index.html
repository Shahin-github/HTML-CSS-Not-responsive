            <p>Obviously, any and all of these are absolutely fantastic any time of day including breakfast, but that is
                not the toast I am recommending here. The thing about avocado toast is that it is simple. Make toast,
                smush avocado, season, and eat.

                <br>
                <p>Sprinkle grated tomato with a pinch of salt and put the seasoned
                    grated tomatoes in a colander over a bowl. Let drain for an hour at room temp.</p>

                <h3>Recipe Of Vegetables</h3>
                <br>
                <p> place on a rack over a sheet pan, and where appropriate, cut into slices or smaller pieces. Heat
                    your oven as low as it will go: Most ovens start at 150°, but 200° is okay.

                <h3>Recipe Of Chinese</h3>
                <br>
                <p>The butter is the key to my tomato toast. Sure, olive oil is good, but buttered toast is breakfast
                    to me, and butter and tomato are great pals. Want a bit of a bonus breakfast surprise?</p>

                <p>I ordered polao with roast and borhani. Polao and borhani is delicious but roast is bit gravy as full
                    of masala and tastes bit robust.As compare to BD circumstances it is on average and not bad at all.

                    like 5-6 times in last one year or so.
